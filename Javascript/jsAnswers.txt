1) first output is the result of the function which is 25
    
    second output is of the same function and it is 81
    
    third output is the number of calls, 2 because the function was called 2 times with the previous calls
    
    fourth output is undefined, thats because we are trying to print a local variable from another function, 
    when the execution of that funciton ends that variable is not reachable in the stack anymore
